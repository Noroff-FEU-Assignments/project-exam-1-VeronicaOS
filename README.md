For this project I was tasked to create a blog site and I could choose the design and the topics. I chose a baking blog where you could find several delicious recipes, information about the fictional creator and more. 

## Description

This was my first exam at Noroff and the first project where we had to use all the skills we had learn throughout the year. It started off with the design in Figma and then I made the blog site with HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Wordpress as a headless CMS as well.
